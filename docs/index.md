# Trubar

A tool for translation and localization of Python programs via modification of source files. It replaces the original strings either with translations to produce a sources in a different language, or with lookups into table of translations.

Trubar supports f-strings and does not require any changes to the original source code, such as marking strings for translation.

See [Getting Started](getting-started.md) for a simple introduction.

## Installation

Install trubar using `pip`.

```
pip install trubar
```
